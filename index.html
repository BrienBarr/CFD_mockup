          <h1>My Story</h1>
          <p>In the world of technology we have turned our Thomas Guides  into brilliant works of art on GPS. The descriptive detours, traffic updates and fastest routes assist in getting to destinations not only efficiently but quickly. When achieving life goals without such guides, one will find themselves walking aimlessly through streets leading to nowhere. Left turns become dead ends. U turns have you finding yourself back at step one, or even worse, Ground Zero. How does one create and use a “Life Thomas Guide”? The idea is that maps like code for desire or law of attraction could help one achieve greatness. 
            So, you have an idea. A goal you want to achieve for yourself that will catapult your life into happiness, prosperity or even a size six dress. Some of you might find a lover holding you at night to be that goal. Others desire a hefty back account. Revving up a beautiful Gunmetal gray Lamborghini in front of a beachside property could be a great daydream. The yearly ritual, at the stroke of midnight, and a promise for a better year is possible with a map.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here are several steps to ensure your map is updated and leading you down your right path in life.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Find a goal and want that goal wholeheartedly. See it, taste it and breathe it. 
                Manifesting is not only creating the idea but wanting it so badly that you will do anything to get it.
              </li>
              <li>
                Once you are hooked, it’s time to get the trusty pen and paper to manifest it into the universe. 
                Many millionaires, visionaries and entrepreneurs have mentioned their manifestation started on a napkin. 
                This step is very similar to that process. 
                Grab a piece of paper and a blue or black pen. 
                It must be a blue or black! If you don’t have a piece of paper grab a napkin.
              </li>
              <li>
                Begin writing. There is no order, organization or proper way of manifesting your desire. 
                It can look like a scrambled mess or an organized PowerPoint presentation. Just wright. 
                Put down all your must haves and your daydreams. Don’t forget to be extremely detailed. 
                The code for your desire is to be very aware of what you want including the color of that dress, 
                the interior of the car or the amount in your bank account by which day.  
                Whatever you do, do not jot down what you don’t want! 
                For example if you’re looking for a man that is tall write down his height. 
                Writing “ I do not want a short man” is not how law of attraction works. 
                Be descriptive again on what you want and it will manifest into reality.         
              </li>
              <li>
                The last step, and I would say one of the most important steps, do not stand in your own way. 
                Whatever goal you’re trying to manifest is not unreachable. All desires can happen as long as you don’t stop them. 
                Don’t be afraid to put $1 million in your bank account. 
                Get excited to flaunt your new body in your dream dress. Pedal to the metal when you’re sitting at that red light.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Enjoy this process as it will be the beginning to an incredible life that you’ve always dreamt of. 
            Find yourself eager about these tasks and hopeful to see them become reality. 
            Creating your code for desire map, walking the path through manifestation and finding yourself at your destination is truly magic.
